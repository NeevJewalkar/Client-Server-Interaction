# Client-Server-Interaction

Client server interaction is a project on sharing data using the apis,
you need to clone the repo and go to the repo file, then you need to run the script `$ node index.js`,
you should have a port running on 8080, go http://localhost:8080, here you will see the number input,
input a number from 1 - 10 and click on the button next to it,
go to the server [HERE](https://client-server-interaction-server.neevcuber.repl.co/) and you should be seeing the sum of your number added to the server!
